# Step 1: Clowning Around(광대짓)

The first area of code I'll need you to fix is the activity assignment engine.

> 첫번째로 수정할 부분은 할당 엔진입니다.

It repeatedly creates groups of size 5-10 guests.
Each group is directed to go to an activity, which can hold up to a certain number of them at a time.

It looks like the clowns didn't change too much on this one.
They mostly just removed a few type annotations and changed one value.

Could you please add back missing type annotations to avoid evolving or implicit `any`s, and fix the wrong value?
